# Squid_Games_Simulator

In this project I made a simple game to follow the trend about the red light green light Squid Game. Specifically i use python and opencv library to realize. With motion detection, finger calculation, and face detection it all works. When the game starts, the character is moved from the start point to the finish point by clenching your finger.  until when the red light is expected there is no movement to pass it.  if it detects movement at a red light then face detection will work to aim at your head
